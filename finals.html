While in her Phasetrance, she channels her Siren energy to form powerful arms that can shoot blasts of force or crush enemies in their grip. Brash, aggressive, and self-assured, Amara doesn’t let anything stand in her way.</p>

An emergent AI driven in an ongoing quest for self-discovery, FL4K wanders from world to world accompanied by beasts. While they feel an connection with the primal wisdom of animals, the social construct of humans are strange to them. On their endless hunt, FL4K’s loyal Skag, Spiderant, and Jabber companions help them track and claim their quarry, be it human, Vault Monster, or anything in between. </p>

She uses an action skill to digistruct and climb into her bipedal tank, Iron Bear, which has hardpoints suitable for mixing, matching, and mounting high-velocity Railguns, rapid-firing Miniguns, semi-automatic Grenade Launchers, flamethrowers, pneumatic fists, and homing rocket launchers. Moze was originally a soldier in the Vladof army's Ursa Corps, a mechanized infantry division that utilized bipedal, 15-ton "Iron Bear" mechs. She became a battle-hardened veteran of many ludicrously dangerous battles across the six galaxies and rose to the rank of Gunner First Class. </p>
