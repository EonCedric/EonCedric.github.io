An emergent AI driven in an ongoing quest for self-discovery, FL4K wanders from world to world accompanied by beasts. While they feel an connection with the primal wisdom of animals, the social construct of humans are strange to them. On their endless hunt, FL4K’s loyal Skag, Spiderant, and Jabber companions help them track and claim their quarry, be it human, Vault Monster, or anything in between. </p>

Moze was originally a soldier in the Vladof army's Ursa Corps, a mechanized infantry division that utilized bipedal, 15-ton "Iron Bear" mechs. She became a battle-hardened veteran of many ludicrously dangerous battles across the six galaxies and rose to the rank of Gunner First Class. </p>
