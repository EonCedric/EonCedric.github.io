<p> My name is Eon Cedric D. Publeo of IT101. I am a student of Adamson University. I am an aspiring IT. I was interested in technology when I was a kid when I first gain my first console game which was the gameboy. It was given to us by our uncle who is staying in USA. He gave us a gameboy flip and this was the first meeting of myself and technology. I am obsessed with playing video games and it is a stress - relieving act for me. It is also more fun if I have someone playing the same game with me. I like Japanese songs but it does not mean that I do not like other genre. I like Pop, EDM, pop - rock in general but it is mostly in the Japanese genre as of today. I like the color white, it shows a blank slate and it you can paint anything you like on it, creating a whole new image on top of it. I like both dogs and cat, I think they are the cutest. I also think that the sheep we made in the belen for our school is cute. My motto in life is "Always choose what makes you happy, A happy you is a healthy you."
